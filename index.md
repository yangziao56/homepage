## About Me
I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at Brandeis University, advised by Prof. [Hongfu Liu](https://hongfuliu.com). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2022. You can find my CV <a href="/pdf/CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

During these years, I had the opportunity to intern in industry and greatly enjoyed the experience. I worked with Dr. Lei Zhang at Adobe, Dr. Qi Lu at Y Combinator China, and Dr. Jiaxing Zhang at IDEA.



## Research Interests

- **Data-Centric AI**
- **Large Language Model**
- **Spatiotemporal Modeling**
- **Meta-Learning**

## Personal
I've always had a strong interest in entrepreneurship, and my future ambition is closely tied to these fields. I'm particularly inspired by how great ideas evolve into impactful products, and I'm continually learning how successful teams build, scale, and bring technologies to market. Before graduate school, I dedicated years to competitive swimming and reached the National Level-1 standard, an experience that shaped my discipline and appreciation for rigorous training. In my free time, skiing in winter and playing tennis year-round are among my favorite activities—I’d be more than happy to connect with others who share these interests!
